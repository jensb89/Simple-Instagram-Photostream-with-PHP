#Simple-Instagram-Photostream-with-PHP

To simply show your last photos from Instagram. Nothing more, nothing less ;)

First you need an Access Token. 
Just register an app at http://instagram.com/developer/clients/manage/
and fill in the Access Token in the PHP file. 
You also need to replace {user-id} with your user-id. 
You can get your user-id here: http://yvesvanbroekhoven.github.com/get-your-instagram-user-id/
